// Understanding the Command Line. Long Live the Command Line!

// If you're operating system is a Pistachio, then the actual nut is the Kernel.
// And in computing, the Kernel refers to the actual program that interfaces with the hardware.
// So it's the core of your operating system.
// Now the Shell in computing refers to the user interface for you as a human to be able to interact with the kernel and in turn with the hardware of your computer.
// And there's two variants to the shell.There are Graphical User Interface Shells,so for example, when you open up Finder, you're using a graphical user interface to access and find your files,but there's also a Command Line Interface,this is an alternative way of interfacing with the kernel.

//Bash Shell - Bounrne Agian Shell
//It is a Command line interface for the unix system

//Command line is used at the end of the day because you need a greater control
