//The Backend

//Full-stack = Front-end (Client facing side) + Back end (Server side)

//What is the Backend?
// It consists of mainly 3 components: Server (basically a computer) + Application (the logic that enables the web app to function) + Database (where we can store and retrieve data)
// Server - for a live website it must be on for 24/7 so it can fetch the details, any computer that is connected to the network is a server
// Application - the logic written determines how you want to respond to the requests from the browser
// eg: how it should respond to button clicks and sending status code when error occurs
// Database - Store the user data

// Web pages - are the ones which only have front-end - bits of html,css,js - these just need a place to store i.e Github

// Web Applications:
// Take an example of an application where it is allows the users to login, so user enters the email and password, these two are passes as a request to the server, so it finds the application that knows how to handle the login i.e it may be a .js file, so we look into the database and act accordingly

// Eg: Restaurant - front-end, Kitchen - backend, pantry - database
