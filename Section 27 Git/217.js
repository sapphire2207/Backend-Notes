// Git remote repositories:-

// Remote repositroy - which is hosted on someone else's server or computer using github
// So to push an existing repository that we have got locally onto this remote repository we need to copy the address of github repository and use 2 commands on command line
// So to tell my local repository that i've created a remote repository somewhere on internet and i want to tranfer all my commits over there: git remote add origin <url of your remote repository>
// Now using: git push -u origin main --> we are pushing the local repository to remote using the u flag which basicallly links bothe the repositories

// Main Branch:- is your main branch of commits or save points, and it is sequentially, this where your main progress is saved / committed
// local repository is git file, and remote repository is github which hosts our code and changes and commits
