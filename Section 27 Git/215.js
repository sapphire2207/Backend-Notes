// Intro to Version control and Git:-

// Version Control:
// You can either compare your current code file, so the current mess that you've made against a previous version, to add any of the save points before. Alternatively, you can simply just roll back to a previous version and it doesn't have to be the one that was immediately previous,you can go as far back or as far forwards as you like as long as you know which version you want.
