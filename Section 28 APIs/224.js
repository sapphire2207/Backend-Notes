// Introduction to APIs:-

// API - Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols, that define how different softwares can interact with each other, It bridges the communication between different pieces of software using an interface 

//Maybe you're building a diary website where the user can jot down an entry for each day in their life.In addition to all the text that they get to write, you also want to add a little icon at the beginning of each entry that shows the weather for that day. You can, of course, get the user to look it up and pick a weather icon, but it's much better if this was automated.

// Now, while you're building your website, you look around and you see that there is a company called OpenWeather that stores and captures weather data and they have that weather data available in their database. And it's updated frequently and it's available for all the locations in the world, and you think, wow, perfect, that's exactly what I need.

// I need to be able to talk to these servers to bring their weather data into my website. So how do you do that? You don't know what their database is written in. It could be some sort of programming language you've never heard of.You don't know how to access their backend servers. You don't know what the rules are that governs those servers.

// You basically have absolutely no idea of how this website or their data storage works, and that is when the API comes in to save you. So in this case, OpenWeather creates an API that tells you how you can interact with their services. If you want data from them, then there are these and these things that you can access.
// So now you should make a request from your website through this and get whatever you require i.e we are nothing but basically making a GET request to beget some data from OpenWeather and in respone you get some data
// So API tells how you can make these requests and how's the data that's coming back is structured

// There are different types of APIs such as GraphQL, SOAP, REST, gRPC ==> these are different architectural styles for creating APIs

// REST APIs:
// It's an API that follows a particluar set of rules, and we use HTTP protocols to interact with the API

// EXERCISE:- Using postman get the live latitude and longitude of the location of teh satellite
