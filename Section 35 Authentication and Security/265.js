// Introduction to Authentication

// So why do we need to authenticate?
// Well, as we're creating our website or web app for users to use, then these users are going to start generating data in the website. They might like certain posts, they might interact with other users, there might be messages created or recipes created, there's always going to be some user data created.

// And in order to associate those pieces of data with individual users, we need to create an Account for each user So they would sign up to our website using a username and a password. And we would essentially create kind of like an ID card for them to uniquely identify them on our database and to save all of the data that they generate onto that account. So the next time that they come back onto the website, they'll be able to use their username and password and log in to our website and be able to access all of those possibly private pieces of information.

// So this way you don't end up with everybody being able to see, you know, what private messages you're sending around on Facebook or see your direct messages on Twitter.

// Now, the other reason why you might want to add authentication to your website is to restrict access to certain areas of the website, depending on the status of the user.
// So for example, if you were Spotify or Netflix and you charge a subscription for accessing certain parts of the website, then once the user pays, you have to update their account in your database to say that they have paid and they'll be allowed to access the TV shows or songs that they're entitled to.
